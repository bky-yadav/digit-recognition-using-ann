## Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains a deep learning model built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to recognize handwritten digits.
Leveraging the power of deep learning, our model is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits to accurately classify and identify numerals from 0 to 9.
With the implementation of the ANN algorithm, we have achieved robust performance in digit recognition tasks, making it suitable for various applications such as optical character recognition (OCR), digitized document processing, and more.
Explore the code and data to understand how the model was trained and deploy it for your own digit recognition projects.
